# Part One: Building a StringServer
## Objective
We were given the task to create a web server named `StringServer` that would keep a list of strings. The user would be able to add strings to that list by sending request via the URI. 
## Code
The webserver is composed of two files: 
* StringServerHandler.java - including `ServerHttpHandler` class (with `handlerRequest` method, `printString` method) and `stringServer` class (with the `main` method).
*  Server.java - composed of `URLHandler` interface, `ServerHttpHandler` class and the `Server` class.
