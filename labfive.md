During the lab session in week 7, we performed a series of tasks with time restraint as we competed with other groups in our lab session. The tasks included the following:

1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Setup Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

As we found out, there was a way to speed this whole process, up by writing a bash script, which would perform all the tasks at one time, which reduces the time wasted typing out each command.
